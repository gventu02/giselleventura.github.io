  <h2>Data Scientist | AI Researcher | Biomedical Engineer</h2>
  
  <p>
    I build AI systems that bridge biological complexity and computational innovation. 
    Currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at Tufts University, I combine 
    5+ years of biomedical engineering experience with machine learning expertise 
    to solve problems at the intersection of biology and technology.

  <p>
    My work spans predictive modeling for medical devices, large-scale biological 
    data analysis, and AI agents for multi-database integration. I'm passionate 
    about translating complex biological questions into computational solutions 
    that accelerate scientific discovery.
